# esp32_ota
I'm using this public repository to test OTA (over the air) updates for the ESP32 microcontroller through Github, that is - the ESP32 will pull updated firmware directly from Github whenever there is a new version available.

This feature is especially useful in irrigation projects that I am developing in the background to automatically water plants and monitor plant status through the cloud.
